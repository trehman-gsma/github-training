# Little Red Riding Hood 2 - The Return of the Wolf

## Chapter 1 – The Warning
The forest had grown strangely quiet.  
Little Red Riding Hood felt it as she walked the familiar path.

At her grandmother’s cottage, she saw muddy footprints by the door—far too many for one wolf.  
That night, she dreamed of glowing eyes and distant howls.

By morning, the village bell was ringing.  
People whispered in fear as one voice cried out:

"The wolves are coming."
